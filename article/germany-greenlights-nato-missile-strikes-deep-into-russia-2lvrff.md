Chancellor Friedrich Merz said that Germany along with Ukraine's other key Western backers had lifted range restrictions on weapons they send to Kyiv. 'There are no longer any range restrictions on weapons delivered to Ukraine - neither by the British nor by the French nor by us nor by the Americans,' he said. 'Ukraine can now defend itself, for example, by attacking military positions in Russia... With very few exceptions, it didn't do that until recently. It can now do that.' The previous German government had strongly supported Kyiv, but stopped short of sending it long-range Taurus missiles, fearing further escalation with Russia. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said today that the new policy would run counter to aspirations for a political settlement to the crisis. The U.S. has been negotiating with Ukraine and Russia to try to bring an end to the conflict after more than three years. But French President Emmanuel Macron said today that Donald Trump had finally realised that Putin was not looking for peace. 'President Trump realises that when President Putin said on the phone he was ready for peace, or told his envoys he was ready for peace, he lied,' Macron said. In a rare rebuke of the Russian leader, Trump said on Truth Social late Sunday in Washington: 'I've always had a very good relationship with Vladimir Putin of Russia, but something has happened to him. He has gone absolutely CRAZY!' Merz vowed that 'we will do everything in our power to continue supporting Ukraine, including militarily', in close coordination with other supporters. He has in the past said he favours delivery of Taurus missiles, which could strike targets deep inside Russia. His government has since stressed it would no longer detail what arms it is sending to Ukraine, preferring a stance of strategic ambiguity. The Kremlin on Monday said European countries lifting restrictions on long-range missile capabilities for Ukraine would be a dangerous move.
