Chancellor Friedrich Merz said that Germany along with Ukraine's other key Western backers had lifted range restrictions on weapons they send to Kyiv. 'There are no longer any range restrictions on weapons delivered to Ukraine - neither by the British nor by the French nor by us nor by the Americans,' he said. 'Ukraine can now defend itself, for example, by attacking military positions in Russia... With very few exceptions, it didn't do that until recently. It can now do that.' The previous German government had strongly supported Kyiv, but stopped short of sending it long-range Taurus missiles, fearing further escalation with Russia. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said today that the new policy would run counter to aspirations for a political settlement to the crisis. The U.S. has been negotiating with Ukraine and Russia to try to bring an end to the conflict after more than three years. But French President Emmanuel Macron said today that Donald Trump had finally realised that Putin was not looking for peace. 'President Trump realises that when President Putin said on the phone he was ready for peace, or told his envoys he was ready for peace, he lied,' Macron said. In a rare rebuke of the Russian leader, Trump said on Truth Social late Sunday in Washington: 'I've always had a very good relationship with Vladimir Putin of Russia, but something has happened to him. He has gone absolutely CRAZY!' German Chancellor Friedrich Merz takes part in a discussion on stage of the 'Re:Publica 25' fair ground in Berlin on May 26, 2025.

'I've always said that he wants ALL of Ukraine, not just a piece of it, and maybe that's proving to be right, but if he does, it will lead to the downfall of Russia!' The US president has been trying to broker an end to the war, but has failed to extract any major concessions from the Kremlin, despite repeated negotiations between his administration and Russia and several phone calls between him and Putin. Macron said Monday he hoped Trump's anger at Moscow translated 'into action' as Europe hardened its own response to Russian aggression. 'We have seen once again in recent hours Donald Trump express his anger. A form of impatience. I simply hope now that this translates into action,' he said. He suggested that Putin had tricked Trump by engaging in diplomatic talks surrounding a peace deal, even after meeting with his envoy Steve Witkoff on four different occasions. Despite making overtures to peace, Putin has expanded attacks on Ukraine in recent days. At least 13 people were killed and dozens injured in Ukraine overnight Saturday into Sunday after Russia fired 367 drones and missiles west. It was the largest combined aerial attack since the full-scale invasion in February 2022. Between Sunday and Monday, Russia launched another 355 drones and nine cruise missiles against Ukraine, per Kyiv's air force. Ukraine said it was the largest drone-only attack of the war so far. Russia argued the attacks were a response to Ukrainian attacks on 'social infrastructure'.

With the mass attacks undermining Putin's claims that Russia seeks peace, Merz, in Germany, vowed that 'we will do everything in our power to continue supporting Ukraine, including militarily', in close coordination with other supporters. He has in the past said he favours delivery of Taurus missiles, which could strike targets deep inside Russia. His government has since stressed it would no longer detail what arms it is sending to Ukraine, preferring a stance of strategic ambiguity. Speaking in a lengthy interview with public broadcaster WDR, Merz did not say whether Germany would now send Taurus missiles to Kyiv. Merz did take the opportunity to slam Putin's reluctance to engage in peace talks. The Kremlin chief has responded to diplomatic efforts to bring the conflict to a close by prosecuting the war 'harder than before', Merz told WDR. 'Putin obviously sees offers of talks as a sign of weakness,' Merz said. The Kremlin on Monday said European countries lifting restrictions on long-range missile capabilities for Ukraine would be a dangerous move, Kremlin correspondent Alexander Yunashev reported. Since US President Donald Trump returned to the White House this year, he has sought to push the two sides in the conflict toward direct talks at the highest level.

Trump last week suggested the Vatican as a possible host for a meeting, with the Italian government saying the leader of the Catholic Church was ready to organise talks. But Moscow has cast doubt on the potential for the Holy See as a host. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said it would be 'inelegant' for the Catholic Church to mediate discussions between two principally Orthodox Christian countries. Merz said that Ukraine's Western backers had sought to use all the diplomatic options available to them to initiate talks. 'After the last three weeks, no one can seriously accuse us of not having exhausted all available diplomatic means,' Merz said. Short of 'raising the white flag', Ukraine's supporters had 'done everything' they could. 'If even an offer to meet at the Vatican does not get (Putin's) approval, then we must be prepared for this war to last longer than we all wish or can imagine.'
